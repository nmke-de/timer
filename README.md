# Timer

**Timer** is a very simple timer program for CLI.

## But why?

To measure time without bloat.

## Dependencies

- C Compiler
- Libc
- Make

## Build

Type `make`. To install, type `make install`, which respects the `INSTALL_DIR` environment variable to control in which directory the timer is installed.

## Usage

`timer` will start the timer. To quit, press `Control + C`, or kill the program will `kill(1)`.
